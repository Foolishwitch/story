Moldy stumbled across trees, tripping on branches, and crawling through the dirt in order to get back home. Up ahead was a generic looking house. Moldy politely slammed the door. Nobody answered. Moldy vomited on the doorsteps. Moldy walked around the house, since Moldy had to get in one way or another. The windows were wide open. Moldy climbed through the window and landed into the kitchen sink. The kitchen smelt like burnt plastic. Moldy rolled out of the sink and landed on the kitchen floor. The floor was covered in hair. It seems this household shaves often."
, 
" Moldy's senses tingled. There was someone else in this household. The sound of screaming could be heard from upstairs. Moldy crawled up the stairs to check on the screams. It appeared someone was attempting to sing in the bathroom, while the screams got quieter. Moldy had never heard such an awful vocal cord. Moldy vomited in front of the bathroom doors. Moldy stumbled back towards the staircase, when a piece of art caught the eyes of a true critic. Moldy quietly walked towards the masterpiece. The room Moldy stumbled upon appeared to belong to an edgy teen. A poster of Sonic the Hedgehog hung on the ceiling, indicating some sort of outdated gamer. Plushies were scattered across the floor, which leads to Moldy concluding this is a person with a mental age of 10. On the bed, an adult sized bear onesie was spread out. Moldy could only conclude this person was heavily involved in furry scene."

" Moldy quickly grabbed the masterpiece, opened the windows and jumped out. The snow broke Moldy's fall. "]
